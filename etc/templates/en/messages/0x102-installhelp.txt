  - You have three installation options: server, agent or local.
  
    - If you choose 'server', you will be able to analyze all  
      the logs, create e-mail notifications and responses,   
      and also receive logs from remote syslog machines and  
      from systems running the 'agents' (from where traffic  
      is sent encrypted to the server).
      
    - If you choose 'agent'(client), you will be able to read
      local files (from syslog, snort, apache, etc) and forward
      them (encrypted) to the server for analysis.             

    - If you choose 'local', you will be able to do everything  
      the server does, except receiving remote messages from  
      the agents or external syslog devices.

  - Choose 'server' if you are setting up a log/analysis server.
  
  - Choose 'agent' if you have another machine to run as a log
    server and want to forward the logs to the server for analysis.
    (ideal for webservers, database servers ,etc)
    
  - Choose 'local' if you only have one system to monitor.
