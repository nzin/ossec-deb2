     OSSEC HIDS is a free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License (version 2) as
     published by the FSF - Free Software Foundation.

     For the full license text please see "/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2".
    
     In addition, certain source files in this program permit linking with the
     OpenSSL library (http://www.openssl.org), which otherwise wouldn't be allowed
     under the GPL.  For purposes of identifying OpenSSL, most source files giving
     this permission limit it to versions of OpenSSL having a license identical to
     that listed in this file (see section "OpenSSL LICENSE" below). It is not
     necessary for the copyright years to match between this file and the OpenSSL
     version in question.  However, note that because this file is an extension of
     the license statements of these source files, this file may not be changed
     except with permission from all copyright holders of source files in this
     program which reference this file.
     
     Note that this license applies to the source code, as well as
     decoders, rules and any other data file included with OSSEC (unless
     otherwise specified).
    
     For the purpose of this license, we consider an application to constitute a 
     "derivative work" or a work based on this program if it does any of the
     following (list not exclusive):
    
      * Integrates source code/data files from OSSEC.
      * Includes OSSEC copyrighted material.
      * Includes/integrates OSSEC into a proprietary executable installer.
      * Links to a library or executes a program that does any of the above.
    
     This list is not exclusive, but just a clarification of our interpretation
     of derived works. These restrictions only apply if you actually redistribute
     OSSEC (or parts of it).
    
     We don't consider these to be added restrictions on top of the GPL, 
     but just a clarification of how we interpret "derived works" as it 
     applies to OSSEC. This is similar to the way Linus Torvalds has
     announced his interpretation of how "derived works" applies to Linux kernel
     modules. Our interpretation refers only to OSSEC - we don't speak
     for any other GPL products. 
    
     OSSEC HIDS is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
     ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

      The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
      the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
      See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
      Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
      please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
