Things TODO for the OSSEC package:

Packages:
---------

- [all] Disable use of chroot() in the code (through #ifdef or a given
  command line option) and check that the daemons can work fine without running
  in chroot (i.e. chroot_flag = 0)

- Check if /var/ossec/etc/ossec-init.conf needs to be generated. 
    Since it is used for upgrades in install.sh it might not be necessary.
    dpkg should handle upgrades by itself.

- [all] Generate + install the init.d file for the packages
    DONE - for the server

- [all] Setup system checking, rootkit detection and log monitor in the
  post-install

- [agent] Configure with server IP addresss in post-install

- [server] Configure email notifications and remote syslog in post-install


Other:
------

- Obtain a license exception from upstream regarding the linking with
  OpenSSL. 
    See Message-ID: <20110803214711.GE19295@javifsp.no-ip.org>
  
  Note1: debian/patches/00-openSSL-license-exception.patch includes the patch
   that upstream needs to include in order to add the OpenSSL exception to the 
   source code.

  Note2: NO, debian/patches/00-disable-openSSL.patch is not enough. If the code
   is not linked then it uses its own implementation for SHA-1 and MD5 which
   comes (copy & paste) from the OpenSSL library headers.

- Debconf messages + po-debconf infrastructure
   Note: Debconf messages (+translations) can be based on the template
   questions in src/etc/templates/

- Remove ossec users on purge? (at least userm and userd)

DONE
----

- License review and update debian/copyright accordingly
  NOTE: Some files are not (c) TrendMicro, for example, the following come from OpenSSL
  and their (C) and license should be acknowledged:
  src/os_crypto/sha1/md32_common.h, src/os_crypto/sha1/sha.h, and
  src/os_crypto/sha1/sha_locl.h

- Move changes to debian/patches (if any).
    Setup dpatch infrastructure.
