Things TODO for the OSSEC package:

Packages:
---------

- Check if /var/ossec/etc/ossec-init.conf needs to be generated. 
    Since it is used for upgrades in install.sh it might not be necessary.
    dpkg should handle upgrades by itself.

- [all] Generate + install the init.d file for the packages

- [all] Setup system checking, rootkit detection and log monitor in the
  post-install

- [agent] Configure with server IP addresss in post-install

- [server] Configure email'notifications and remote syslog in post-install


Other:
------

- License review and update debian/copyright accordingly

- Debconf messages + po-debconf infrastructure
   Note: Debconf messages (+translations) can be based on the template
   questions in src/etc/templates/


- Move changes to debian/patches (if any).
    Setup dpatch infrastructure.
