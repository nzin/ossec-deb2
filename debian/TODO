Things TODO for the OSSEC package:

Packages:
---------

- [agent] Configuration:
    + Adjust the configuration files (etc/ossec-agent.conf) to it them
    automatically useful upon installation 

    + Configure with server IP addresss in post-install (requires debconf prompt)

    + Setup system checking, rootkit detection and log monitor in the
    post-install

- [server] Configuration:

    + Adjust the configuration files (etc/ossec-server.conf) to make it useful
      post-installation

    + Configure email notifications and remote syslog in post-install (requires
      debconf prompt)

- [all] Package purge:
    - Remove the log files from the directory on purge
    - Remove ossec users on purge

Other:
------

- Obtain a license exception from upstream regarding the linking with
  OpenSSL. 
    See Message-ID: <20110803214711.GE19295@javifsp.no-ip.org>
  
  Note1: debian/patches/00-openSSL-license-exception.patch includes the patch
   that upstream needs to include in order to add the OpenSSL exception to the 
   source code.

  Note2: NO, debian/patches/00-disable-openSSL.patch is not enough. If the code
   is not linked then it uses its own implementation for SHA-1 and MD5 which
   comes (copy & paste) from the OpenSSL library headers.

- Debconf messages + po-debconf infrastructure
   Note: Debconf messages (+translations) can be based on the template
   questions in src/etc/templates/


DONE
----

- License review and update debian/copyright accordingly
  NOTE: Some files are not (c) TrendMicro, for example, the following come from OpenSSL
  and their (C) and license should be acknowledged:
  src/os_crypto/sha1/md32_common.h, src/os_crypto/sha1/sha.h, and
  src/os_crypto/sha1/sha_locl.h

- Move changes to debian/patches (if any).
    Setup patch infrastructure.
 
  DONE - uses quilt

- Check if /var/ossec/etc/ossec-init.conf needs to be generated. This 
  file needs to include the basic configuration for OSSEC including the
  type of installation.

  DONE - included in the packages based on upstream. Note: Date is fake, upstream
   sets it on installation. Relevant?

- [all] Disable use of chroot() in the code (through #ifdef or a given
  command line option) and check that the daemons can work fine without running
  in chroot (i.e. chroot_flag = 0)

   DONE - see patches in debian/patches/: 03-disable-chroot-default.patch,
           02-add-chroot-option.patch    


- [all] Generate + install the init.d file for the packages
    DONE 

- Do not use src/init/ossec-server.sh in the init script but instead put the
  relevant code in the init script

  NOT for the moment - there is a lot of code in the control script and is
    susceptible to change upstream.
    For the time being it is patched to put the PIDfiles in the proper
    location and to hardcode the pid directory

  This makes the INIT script in Debian similar to the ones available 
  in src/init: 
	ossec-hids-aix.init      ossec-hids-rh.init       ossec-hids-suse.init
	ossec-hids-gentoo.init   ossec-hids-solaris.init  
  Although at the cost of having less contro.
